# Illumio repository review - 2026-05-01

## Repository identity

- Remote: `https://github.com/jweidenh/Illumio.git`
- Branch reviewed: `main`
- Starting commit: `69107ccd567a3d289a4e51d60fa42dfdf53d4e39`
- Purpose observed: one-time Illumio PCE single-node client install helper, not a standing service.

## Initial findings

- The only tracked file was `install_illumio.sh`; there was no README, tests, ignore rules, or operator guidance.
- The script used hardcoded placeholder/site values (`illumio.dev`, `admin@email.com`, `x.x.x.x`) that could be accidentally installed.
- Real host mutation happened immediately after root/file checks, with no dry-run or explicit confirmation gate.
- Runtime YAML pointed at source certificate paths while the script copied certs into Illumio's cert directory.
- Password handling supported an environment variable, which is easy to leak via process/environment capture.
- The script installed `expect` only after requiring most other commands and did not document required staging inputs.
- Generated/client-specific files such as RPMs, private keys, certs, env files, and password files were not ignored.

## Fixes made

- Reworked `install_illumio.sh` with:
  - `--dry-run`, `--yes`, and `--help` modes.
  - explicit refusal to mutate the host unless `--yes` is supplied.
  - environment-driven configuration with no safe defaults for site-specific values.
  - placeholder validation for FQDN, load balancer IP, and email values.
  - safer initial admin password input via prompt or `ADMIN_PASSWORD_FILE` instead of a default env password; `expect` receives only a root-readable password file path, not the password value in process environment.
  - YAML quoting for generated runtime values.
  - runtime certificate references updated to installed `/var/lib/illumio-pce/cert/...` paths.
  - dry-run wrappers for host-mutating commands and waits.
  - optional `CHECKSUM_MANIFEST` support using `sha256sum --check --strict` for staged package/signing/certificate files.
- Added `README.md` with usage, required variables, safety notes, checksum manifest guidance, and local checks.
- Added `.gitignore` to reduce risk of committing client RPMs, certs, keys, password files, logs, and env files.
- Added `tests/static_checks.py` for repository-level safety regressions.

## Tests and checks run

- `bash -n install_illumio.sh`
- `python3 tests/static_checks.py`
- Code-review blockers fixed: initial admin password is no longer exported to child process environment, and inherited `ADMIN_PASSWORD`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD2` export attributes are cleared before reads.
- `git diff --check`
- `./install_illumio.sh --help`
- basic sensitive-marker scan for private key markers and common token prefixes
- `shellcheck install_illumio.sh` was not run because `shellcheck` is not installed in this environment.

## Remaining risks / operator notes

- This script still performs major host changes when run with `--yes`; use only on the intended Illumio target host after a dry run.
- It assumes an EL9/RHEL-like host with `dnf`, `rpm`, systemd, Illumio RPMs, and Illumio command names matching the staged package version.
- Package checksum verification now exists when a trusted manifest is provided, but client-specific manifests still need to be generated and protected outside the repo.
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD_FILE` is local operator material and must never be committed.
- No client-specific values or secrets were added.
